	<line aside>Neither too wide nor too narrow, there's just some space enough for us two to live our days.</line>
	<chara i="001" pos="0" enter="fade;.5"></chara>
	<line aside>The body of the former lighthouse man was found at the seat where I was sitting last night.</line>
	<line aside>Before a new lighthouse man comes, our friend, Joan, will stay here as a temporary worker for a period of time. So sad——</line>
	<line aside>Chartlace brought various books with colourful covers but hasn't give them a look since we got here.</line>
	
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>Poor man. Suffering from the loneliness for at least three years.</line>
	
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>What was your expression the moment you go, I wonder?</line>
	<line aside>She is fiddling the vestiges left by time with her poker face.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>You came and brought nothing, gone but took nothing. What is the meaning of your life eventually?</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>I don't know, <speed>5</speed>but...</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara><speed>15</speed>The vestiges.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>...</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>They get eternal life as used to contribute to the livings, leaving a memory that will never gone.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>You give me a sense that we're the people on the same way sometimes, Vilo.</line>
	<comment>Both of them are taking out something from the cabinet and put them into their own pockets at the same time, but only Chartlace is illustrated</comment>
	<line aside>Yeah. That's the secret why life is so wonderful——</line>
	<line aside>Chartlace, describing herself as a fugitive princess the day when she encountered with me.</line>
	<line aside>However, no one can give any evidence to proof it, not even herself. There must be something wrong with her.</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>And... I wonder...</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>Why have we come so early. It's noon still.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>We just came here today only. It takes time to get used to this new environment.</line>
	<line aside><speed>18</speed>I guess she is right.</line>
	<line aside>It is also happy that we can be absent from today's work with a good excuse.</line>
	<line aside>A few hours have passed.</line>
	<line aside>She just keeps fiddling the things around until supper. After that she starts to read her colourful books.</line>
	<line aside>In her words, studying is a stepping stone for taking back her throne.</line>
	<line aside>She's the craziest narcissist I have ever seen.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>You see, We have come a long way so far and finally reached here.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>It's almost like a blink for the five years that we spent.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>It's almost done.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>Almost.</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>I guess I won't be surprised whatever happens next.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>How simple it is for me to achieve such a thing. But I was just... like... lack of motivation?</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>I savor every moment we've spent together. And it will last forever if I don't try to break it on purpose.</line>
	<line aside>That's exactly what I'm thinking about.</line>
	<line aside>It would be weird if there isn't a hole on her brain.</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>I understand. But I'm worried about you more than supporting you. It is meaningless to do such a meaningless thing.</line>
	<line aside>——It always worked.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>Thanks, Vilo.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>Though I can't figure out its meaning at the moment, it still remains me a sense that it is my destiny.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>You're never going to give me up, will you?</line>
	<!-- Never gonna give you up (bushi) -->
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>How could I...</line>
	<line aside>Annoying woman...</line>
	<line aside>The sun slowly sets down, as the last ray of scarlet disappears from our faces.</line>
	<line aside>I light up the lantern we brought, letting the flames sway casually in the air. The light fills up the whole room at once.</line>
	<line aside>Long silence after that.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>I'm always thinking about this after I left the palace. How about giving it up when the hour pointer points at XII?</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>Are you finally going to give up?</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>I just don't feel like myself wasting so much time on such an impossible goal.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>Ah hah, it's about bedtime now. Lie down and have a good rest.</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>How kind you are today, Chartlace.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>? What are you talking about, you need to work for me tomorrow, don't you?</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara><exp>worriedly</exp>Quadruple work isn't that easy to finish, especially when lacking of rest. It's rude of that man to deduct your salary.</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara>Is it fine after all? I thought you won't be willing to take this job.</line>
	<line><chara i="001"></chara>Of course, trust me this time.</line>
	<line><chara i="002"></chara><speed>15</speed>Well... Alright...</line>
	<line aside>Hahhh——</line>
	<line aside>I think it's rather to sleep than to refuse, Nobody knows when the next time is after all——</line>
